It is very heavy, so make sure you have some good studs in the wall to support it. I would suggest buying some extra darts for it, as the ones it comes with are cheaply made...had one break on me during my first game.***NOTE*** The installation was very easy, just don\\t listen to the instructions. It tells you to slide the paper inside to mark everything. Just put the paper on the back of the board and poke the holes, saves a lot of frustration and gives you the most accurate markings.'

B005FUKW6M|17592186047680|'5.0,Great quality overall. The cabinet looks very distinguished in my home bar, and hanging it up was easy. The dart board itself tends to be a little tight and bounce darts off in the middle, but I think that might be normal with new cork. And the darts are pretty cheap, but I can get replacements very easily. The biggest thing for me was just getting a good cabinet and dart board, one that didn\\t look like it belonged in a frat house.'

B005FUKW6M|19791209303728|'4.0,I am very pleased with the set. I almost changed my mind about ordering it after reading a few reviews from serious players about the board not being good enough. Which I concede there\\s always something better, this is as good of a board as I have ever used and I have no issues with it at all (thinner wires, which you don\\t see very often would be my only wish).The cabinet is very nice... again, you\\re not paying for a $500 hand-laquered mahogany case built by a skilled craftsman, but you\\re getting a nice looking, decent quality wood case that looks great in your den (or in my case, the living room that\\s being converted to &#34;pub&#34; style).The darts are much better quality than you get in a typical starter set - they have a nice weight and design and work well. Unfortunately, one of the darts has a slightly bent flight holder and the flight pops out on every-other throw. The two sets also look almost identical - a more obvious distinction between the flights would have been nice. I will probably replace the darts with ones that better suit my personal taste, but they are not bad.At the Black Friday additional discount I got, I have no regrets at all. At the slightly higher normal price, it still seems like a pretty good deal, especially considering you could spend the same amount for the case alone.'

B003D9RBMU|2199023259985|'1.0,First of all let me say that I love Condor products. I own a few of their knives, an axe and a machete. For the price they can\t be beat. They are all hard working tools. The Sapien if done right is a handy, do it all easy to handle knife that has a great edge and is easy to keep sharp. The one I received must have escaped without quality control catching it. The edge was dull and wavy and the grind was also wavy with gouges all over it. The scales were awful, not even close to matching and uneven along the tang. The brass pins were sticking up above the handle scales and were sharp. It looked like a grade school kids first attempt at making a knife. I could live with the handle and fix it, and if the blade was just dull I could just sharpen it and be happy. There is really nothing I can do to fix the blade, the grind is so wavy with deep grind marks and burn marks down the whole length. Don\t want to knock the company, they let a bad one slip out and I got it. If it was received in good working order it is a five star knife. My example gets 0 stars.'
